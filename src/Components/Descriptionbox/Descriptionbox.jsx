              <p>I recently purchased this Premium Jacket Shirt and while there are some things
                  I really liked, there were also a few drawbacks.
                  The material is comfortable and feels durable,
                  and I appreciate the stylish design and modern fit. However,
                  I found the sizing to be a bit off; it was tighter than
                  I expected based on the size chart. Additionally, 
                  I worry about its longevity. The zipper seems a bit flimsy and
                  Overall, it's a decent jacket shirt, but with a few improvements, it could be great
